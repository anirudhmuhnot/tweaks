This code is used to extract data from Reminders.app on Mac and convert it into a text file to migrate easily to other platforms.
To do this simply open the Reminders.app in Mac and select the list you want. After that go to file option and export the list. Now run the jupyter notebook to extract the data and create the new file. Cheers.
*change file names where necessary.
